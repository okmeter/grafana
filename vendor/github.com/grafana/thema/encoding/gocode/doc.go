// Package tgo provides tools for generating native Go types from Thema's
// lineage and schema abstractions. Eventually, this package may also support
// generating Thema from Go inputs.
//
// "tgo" is the package name rather than simply "go" because the latter is a
// reserved keyword.
package gocode
